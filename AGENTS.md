# Agent Instructions

## Deployment

Railway CLI has issues in this environment. Use the Railway Dashboard instead:

1. Go to https://railway.app/project/3c6d3e8b-4d98-415b-b230-bdd871584991
2. Click "Deploy" button
3. Or connect GitHub repo for auto-deploy

## Security

Remove package-lock.json when using Bun to avoid false vulnerability warnings.

## Commands

- Build: `bun run build`
- Dev: `bun run dev`
- Deploy Convex: `bun run convex:deploy`
